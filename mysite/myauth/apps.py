"""
This code defines an application configuration class named `MyauthConfig` for the 'myauth' app. Here's the breakdown of the code and its purpose:

1. `from django.apps import AppConfig`: This line imports the `AppConfig` class from the `django.apps` module.

2. `class MyauthConfig(AppConfig):`: This line defines a new class named `MyauthConfig`, which inherits from `AppConfig`. This class represents the configuration for the 'myauth' app.

3. `default_auto_field = 'django.db.models.BigAutoField'`: This line sets the default auto-generated primary key field for models in this app to be a `BigAutoField`. This field is suitable for databases that support 64-bit integers for primary keys.

4. `name = 'myauth'`: This line specifies the name of the Django app, which is 'myauth'. It should match the name of the directory containing the app's code.

The purpose of this configuration class is to provide configuration settings for the 'myauth' app, such as the default auto-generated primary key field.
